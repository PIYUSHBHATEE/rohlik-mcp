# Rohlik MCP Server

**Enhance your favourite LLM with capabilities to buy groceries.**

This is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables AI assistants to interact with the Rohlik Group's online grocery delivery services across multiple countries. This server provides tools for searching products, managing shopping carts, and accessing account info.

**Supported Services:**
- ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¿ **Rohlik.cz** - Czech Republic
- ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª **Knuspr.de** - Germany  
- ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡¹ **Gurkerl.at** - Austria
- ðŸ‡­ðŸ‡º **Kifli.hu** - Hungary
- ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡´ **Sezamo.ro** - Romania
- ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ **Sezamo.it** - Italy (planned)
- ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ **Sezamo.es** - Spain (planned)

Example LLM prompts that work very well with the Rohlik MCP:
- *Add ingredients for apple pie to the cart. Only gluten-free and budget-friendly.*
- *Or actually, instead of apple pie I want to make pumpkin pie. Change the ingredients.*
- *What are the items in my cart?*
- *Add the items in the attached shopping list photo to the cart.*
- *Add the bread I marked as favorite in Rohlik to my cart.*
- *What are the cheapest delivery slots for tomorrow?*

> [!WARNING]
> This MCP server is made by reverse engineering the APIs used by Rohlik Group's websites. Use at your own discretion.

## Usage

### Claude Desktop Configuration

Add the MCP to Claude Desktop configuration:
- On MacOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- On Windows: `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

Add the following configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "rohlik": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@tomaspavlin/rohlik-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "ROHLIK_USERNAME": "your-email@example.com",
        "ROHLIK_PASSWORD": "your-password",
        "ROHLIK_BASE_URL": "https://www.rohlik.cz"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Supported Regions

The server supports multiple Rohlik regions by setting the `ROHLIK_BASE_URL` environment variable:

* **Czech Republic**: `https://www.rohlik.cz` (default)
* **Germany**: `https://www.knuspr.de`
* **Austria**: `https://www.gurkerl.at`
* **Hungary**: `https://www.kifli.hu`
* **Romania**: `https://www.sezamo.ro`
* **Italy** (planned): `https://www.sezamo.it`
* **Spain** (planned): `https://www.sezamo.es`

If `ROHLIK_BASE_URL` is not specified, it defaults to the Czech version.
